# Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

IDS observes network traffic for malicious transactions and sends immediate alerts when it is observed. It is software that checks a network or system for malicious activities or policy violations. Each illegal activity or violation is often recorded either centrally using a SIEM system or notified to an administration. IDS monitors a network or system for malicious activity and protects a computer network from unauthorized access from users, including perhaps insiders. The intrusion detector learning task is to build a predictive model (i.e. a classifier) capable of distinguishing between ‘bad connections’ (intrusion/attacks) and ‘good (normal) connections’.
