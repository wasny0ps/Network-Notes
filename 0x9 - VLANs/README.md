# VLANs

<p><img src-""></p>

VLANs (Virtual LANs) are logical grouping of devices in the same broadcast domain. VLANs are configured on switches by placing some interfaces into one broadcast domain and some interfaces into another. VLANs can be spread across multiple switches. Each VLAN is treated like its own subnet or broadcast domain, which means that frames broadcast onto the network are only switched between the ports within the same VLAN.

### Importance of VLAN

- **Control & Performance**: In switchers without VLANs, the incoming broadcast packet is sent to all ports of the switcher, regardless of whether the end devices receive it. This causes performance issues as it will cause unnecessary packet sending. **Unnecessary broadcast traffic is also blocked** if a network is partitioned using VLANs.
- **Security**: By using VLANs, groups that are not related to each other on a network are prevented from communicating with each other, and measures are taken against a possible external threat. **When the devices on the switcher are allocated to VLANs, a malicious user will not have a chance to connect to any end on the network and listen to the entire network and capture information**. The user will only be able to operate on the VLAN to which he will connect.
- **Scalability**: Broadcast groups are actually created on a network created by creating VLANs. It has the **flexibility to assign a user to the desired VLAN regardless of its physical location on the switcher**. Likewise, a **growing VLAN over time can be transferred to newly created VLANs**. This process is made possible by defining a new port on the switcher. When the same process is attempted without using VLAN support, the connection center for the newly created subnet (network) should be physically provided up to the router.

## Types of VLANs

 - **Data VLAN**: A data VLAN is a VLAN configured to carry non-specialized standard traffic. User-generated Internet traffic can be given as an example. In addition, a VLAN can carry simultaneous voice or video-based traffic. Another name for Data VLAN is User VLAN.
 - **Default VLAN**: All ports on the switcher are automatically included in the Default VLAN when the switcher is started. Having all ports of the switcher connected to the Default VLAN includes these ports in the same broadcast domain. This allows all devices connected to the switcher to communicate with each other. The Default VLAN for Cisco devices is "VLAN 1". VLAN 1 has the same features as other VLANs except that it cannot be renamed or deleted.
 - **Native VLAN**: Local VLAN is the VLAN assigned to the "Trunk" port. A trunk port supports untagged traffic as well as traffic generated by multiple VLANs (tagged traffic). The "Trunk" port forwards traffic not coming from any VLAN to the Local VLAN. Traffic generated by a device and not coming from any VLAN is forwarded over the switcher's VLAN configured as Local VLAN.
 - **Managament VLAN**: A management VLAN can be any VLAN configured to manage the switcher. If no dedicated VLAN is configured as the Management VLAN, "VLAN 1" serves as the Management VLAN. Once an IP address and subnet mask are assigned to the management VLAN, this switcher can be connected via HTTP, Telnet, SSH, or SNMP. Since "VLAN 1" is the Default VLAN on Cisco devices, it is preferable for security to separate the Management VLAN from the Default VLAN.
