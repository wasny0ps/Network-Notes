# Subnet Mask Calculate

## IP And Subnet Mask
A 32-bit IP address uniquely identifies a single device on an IP network. The 32 binary bits are divided into the host and network sections by the subnet mask but they are also broken into four 8-bit octets.

Because binary is challenging, we convert each octet so they are expressed in dot decimal. This results in the characteristic dotted decimal format for IP addressesâ€”for example, 172.16.254.1. The range of values in decimal is 0 to 255 because that represents 00000000 to 11111111 in binary.

Here is an example with the IP Address  **192.168.63.8/24**. First of all, we can find out network and broadcast address. Always network address end with 0 and broadcast address end with 255 because of this **network address is 192.168.63.0** and **broadcast address is 192.168.63.255**. After that, let's find host bits. We can find the **number of host bits as 8 by subtracting the number of network bits from the total number of bits**. Later, we can calculate subnet mask of this IP address with the help of **host bit number**.
