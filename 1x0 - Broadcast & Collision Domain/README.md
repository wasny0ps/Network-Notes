# Collision Domain
A collision domain is, as the name implies, the part of a network where packet collisions can occur. A collision occurs when two devices send a packet at the same time on the shared network segment. The packets collide and both devices must send the packets again, which reduces network efficiency. Collisions are often in a hub environment because each port on a hub is in the same collision domain. By contrast, each port on a bridge, a switch, or a router is in a separate collision domain.
