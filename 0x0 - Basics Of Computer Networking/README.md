# Basics Of Computer Networking

**Open system**: 
A system which is connected to the network and is ready for communication. 

**Closed system**: 
A system which is not connected to the network and canâ€™t be communicated with.

**Computer Network**: 
An interconnection of multiple devices, also known as hosts, that are connected using multiple paths for the purpose of sending/receiving data or media. Computer networks can also include multiple devices/mediums which help in the communication between two different devices; these are known as Network devices and include things such as routers, switches, hubs, and bridges.

## Network Devices

**Hub**: Hub in networking plays a vital role in data transmission, and broadcasting. Hub is a hardware device used at the physical layer to connect multiple devices in the network. Hubs are widely used to connect LANs. A hub has multiple ports and it is a non-intelligent device. It acts as a dumb switch that does not know, which data needs to be forwarded where so it broadcasts or sends the data to each port.
